# Parkinson_Disease_Web_App
I have deployed a Machine Learning Model as a Web App using the Streamlit library in Python. You can use an interpreter like Spyder to write the code and run it. To run the web app you can directly copy the text from the Streamit file that I have provided in this repo, run the text file, and run the web app. You can get the dataset from the website www.kaggle.com.
