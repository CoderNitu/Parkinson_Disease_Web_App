# Parkinson_Disease_Web_App
I have deployed a Machine Learning Model as a Web App using the Streamlit library in Python. You can use an interpreter like Spyder to write the code and run it. To run the web app you can directly copy the text from the Streamit file that I have provided in this repo, run the text file, and run the web app. You can get the dataset from the website www.kaggle.com.

## FUTURE WORK

In the future, these models can be trained with different datasets that have the best features and can be predicted more accurately. If the accuracy rate increases, it can be used by laboratories and hospitals so that it is easy to predict in the early stages. These models can be also used with different medical and disease datasets. In the future the work can be extended by building a hybrid model that can find more than one disease with an accurate dataset and that dataset has common features of two diseases.
